Dataset Overview
Typically includes features such as:

timestamp: Time of the measurement or event

source_ip, dest_ip: Origin and destination of traffic

protocol, port: Communication protocol and port number

feature_xxx: Traffic statistics (packet size, duration, flags, etc.)

label: Whether the record represents an attack or benign traffic

Machine Learning Algorithms
You may use one or more of the following:

Random Forest – Handles high-dimensional data, provides feature importance

Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Effective for binary classification with clear margins

Neural Networks – Captures complex non-linear relationships in data

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing

Clean missing values

Encode categorical features (e.g., protocol)

Scale and normalize numerical features

Handle class imbalance (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling)

Feature Engineering

Extract temporal or statistical features

Use aggregation and windowed statistics for richer patterns

Model Training & Evaluation

Train multiple models

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

Select the best-performing model

Deployment

Use Flask in app.py to serve model predictions

Provide web interface to upload logs and receive attack predictions

Accuracy & Results
Best model achieved around X% accuracy, Y precision, Z recall on a held-out test set.

Feature importance analysis indicated that feature A, feature B, and feature C were the most predictive.

How to Run
