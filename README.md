[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue.svg)]()

##  Overview
A machine learning system that predicts cyber attacks using network traffic data‚Äîleveraging logistic regression, feature engineering, and a user-friendly web interface powered by Flask, HTML, and CSS. Detect threats in real time!

##  Features
-  Data preprocessing pipeline for network traffic  
-  Feature engineering to extract meaningful patterns  
-  Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks  
-  Model performance metrics and visualizations  
-  SHAP explainability for transparent predictions

##  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Srinithimahalakshmi/Cyber-Attack-Prediction.git
cd Cyber-Attack-Prediction

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

You‚Äôll need Python 3.8+ and pip. The repository includes a processed subset of the CIC-IDS2017 dataset.

## Usage

### 1. Data Preprocessing

```bash
python src/data_preprocessing.py
```

### 2. Model Training

Train models such as Random Forest or XGBoost:

```bash
python src/models/train_rf.py
python src/models/train_xgb.py
```

### 3. Model Evaluation

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model models/random_forest.pkl
```

### 4. Generate Predictions

```python
from src.predict import AttackPredictor

predictor = AttackPredictor('models/random_forest.pkl')
sample = [...]  # Input feature vector
prediction = predictor.predict(sample)
print(f"Attack probability: {prediction:.2%}")
```
